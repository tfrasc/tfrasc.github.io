  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="pages/pictures/home3.PNG">
  <h5>I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno. I have minors in Mathematics and Cyber Security. I'm extremely eager to learn and get my foot in the door in industry in Application Programming or Web Development.</h5>
  <h5>I have a strong passion for coding and problem solving and I am always looking to learn something new. I also enjoy dabbling in pentesting and security. I've been interested in computers for as long as I can remember, and my schoolwork and experience have made coding more than just an education for me.</h5>
  <h5>In the summer, when I'm not programming, I'm enjoy hiking and biking around the beautiful hills of Tahoe and Truckee. In the winter you can find me enjoying the world class ski resorts on my snowboard.</h5>
