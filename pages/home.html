    <h5>I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno. I have minors in both Mathematics and Cyber Security. I'm extremely eager to learn more and dive further into the industry of Web, Mobile, and Application Development.</h5>
    <h5>I have a strong passion for coding and problem solving and I am always looking to learn something new. I also enjoy dabbling in pentesting and security. I've been interested in computers for as long as I can remember, and my schoolwork and experience have made coding more than just an education for me.</h5>
    <h5>In the summer, when I'm not programming, I enjoy hiking and biking around the beautiful hills of Tahoe and Truckee. In the winter you can find me snowboarding down the world class ski resorts while listening to Marvin Gaye or some triphop.</h5>
