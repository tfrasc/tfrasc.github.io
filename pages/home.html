  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="pages/pictures/home3.PNG">
  <h5>I'm currently pursuing Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno. I have minors in Mathematics and Cyber Security. I'm looking to get my feet wet in Application Programming or Web Development.</h5>
  <h5>I have a strong passion for coding (really all things computers) and am always eager to learn something new. I also enjoy dabbling in pentesting. I've been interested in computers for as long as I can remember, especially after my first experiences with video games. I quickly realized how cool it would be to make these games and the joy of problem solving eventually led me to love writing code.</h5>
  <h5>Along with my love for coding, I enjoy hiking and biking around the beautiful hills of Tahoe and Truckee.</h5>
